# Example code that creates a list of all of the list of strings in fruits and uppercases every string
output = []
for fruit in fruits:

# Exercise 1 - Rewrite the above example code using list comprehension syntax. Make a variable named uppercased_fruits to hold the output of the list comprehension. Output should be ['MANGO', 'KIWI', etc...]

# Exercise 2 - Create a variable named capitalized_fruits and use list comprehension syntax to produce output like ['Mango', 'Kiwi', 'Strawberry', etc...]

# Exercise 3 - Use a list comprehension to make a variable named fruits_with_more_than_two_vowels. Hint: You'll need a way to check if something is a vowel.

# Exercise 15 - Make a variable named numbers_squared that contains the numbers with each element squared. Output is [4, 6, 9, 16, etc...]

# Exercise 16 - Make a variable named numbers_plus_5. In it, return a list containing each number plus five.

# BONUS Make a variable named "primes" that is a list containing prime numbers in the numbers list. *Hint* you may want to make or find a helper function to determine if a given number is prime or not.
